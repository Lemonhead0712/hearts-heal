# HeartHeals - Free Access Model

## Overview

HeartHeals has transitioned from a subscription-based model to a free access model. All features that were previously restricted to premium subscribers are now available to all users.

### Feature Access

All features are now universally accessible. The application uses a simplified version of the subscription context that always grants access to all features while maintaining the same interface for backward compatibility.

### User Authentication

User authentication is still required for personalized experiences and data persistence, but it is no longer tied to subscription status.

### Analytics

We still track feature usage for analytics purposes, but this doesn't restrict access to any features.

## Technical Notes
